        <p>Barbara Reid (born November 16, 1957) is a Canadian illustrator and author of children's books. She has been called "one of Canada's major literary figures". She was born in Toronto, Ontario and studied at the Ontario College of Art. She began her career creating illustrations for textbooks.
        <br> <br>
        Her illustrations are made by spreading and modelling plasticine to create relief images. After graduating from The Ontario College of Art and Design, the first book she illustrated using plasticine was The New Baby Calf, written by Edith Newlin Chase. Since then she has had the opportunity to work with many outstanding authors such as Kenneth Oppel, Jo Ellen Bogart and Mother Goose.
